# Configuration of groups assignment to mount points.
# Format:
# - Each line of "<PRIVILEGE> <MOUNT_POINT> <ALLOW_SRC> <DENY_SRC>" describes single mapping
#   * <PRIVILEGE>: name of enforced privilege
#   * <MOUNT_POINT>: mount point location
#   * <ALLOW_SRC>: source directory to bind mount when privilege is allowed
#   * <DENY_SRC>: source directory to bind mount when privilege is denied
# - <ALLOW_SRC> and <DENY_SRC> may be set to special value "-". In such case no
#   mount will be performed.
# - Values starting with TZ_ will be treated as tizen-platform-config variables, converted
#   to respective values
# - Elements in line are separated by white space
# - Lines starting with '#' and empty lines are ignored
