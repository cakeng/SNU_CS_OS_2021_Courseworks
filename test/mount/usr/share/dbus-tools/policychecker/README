This is the policy checker for D-Bus. Run it with a D-Bus policy file as an argument:

dbus-policycheck ./test-policy.conf

It shows found violations checked with rules defined in rules.xsl.

To count all violations in system policy config files, run

for i in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/*.conf; do dbus-policycheck "$i" | wc -l ; done
